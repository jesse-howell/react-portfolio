# react-portfolio

## Description

This is an enhanced version of a previous portfolio. The previous project was built using HTML and CSS while this one uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I will be using this as my employment portfolio to showcase my work. Though it is unfinished, it still illustrates the improvements I've made over the course of this boot camp cohort.
